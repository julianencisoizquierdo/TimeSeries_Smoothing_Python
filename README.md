## Content of the project
This is another project where work with Time Series. This time, the goal is to apply different smoothing techniques (moving average, single exponential, double exponential, etc.).


## Files
The files used for the analysis are `smooth_1.npy` and `smooth_2.npy`.


## Usage
To run the analysis, open the `TimeSeries_Smoothing_Python.ipynb` notebook and execute each cell sequentially. Ensure that the required datasets are in the correct file paths.
